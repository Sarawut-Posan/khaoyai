# Task 17: Animations and Transitions - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive animation and transition system for the Khao Yai Presentation app using Framer Motion with full accessibility support.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### ✅ 1. Configure Framer Motion slide transition variants (slide-in from right)
**Files Modified:**
- `components/PresentationContainer.tsx` - Already had slide transitions implemented
- `lib/animations.ts` - Created centralized animation variants

**Implementation:**
- Slide transitions use spring physics (stiffness: 300, damping: 30)
- Slides enter from right when moving forward, left when moving backward
- Smooth opacity fade during transitions (300ms duration)
- Direction-aware animations based on navigation

### ✅ 2. Add staggered fade-in for slide elements (100ms delay)
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/animations.ts` - Added `containerVariants` and `itemVariants`
- All slide components (Slide01-Slide12) - Already using staggered animations

**Implementation:**
- Container staggers children with 100ms delay between elements
- Items fade in from below (20px offset) over 500ms
- Configurable stagger presets (fast: 50ms, normal: 100ms, slow: 200ms)
- Smooth, professional appearance for content reveal

### ✅ 3. Implement hover animations (scale 1.05 with shadow)
**Files Modified:**
- `components/ui/Card.tsx` - Enhanced with Framer Motion hover effects
- `components/ui/Button.tsx` - Enhanced with variant-specific hover animations

**Implementation:**
- **Card Component:**
  - Scale: 1.05 on hover
  - Shadow increases from md to lg
  - Tap scale: 0.98 for tactile feedback
  - 300ms transition duration

- **Button Component:**
  - Primary: Background darkens, shadow increases, scale 1.05
  - Secondary: Background fills with sage color, scale 1.05
  - Ghost: Background fills with sand color, scale 1.05
  - Tap scale: 0.95 for all variants

### ✅ 4. Add loading skeleton screens for images
**Files Created:**
- `components/ui/ImageSkeleton.tsx` - Pulsing skeleton component
- `components/ui/Image.tsx` - Enhanced image component with loading states

**Implementation:**
- **ImageSkeleton:**
  - Pulsing opacity animation (0.5 → 0.8 → 0.5)
  - 1.5s infinite loop with easeInOut
  - Sage color theme matching design system
  - SVG placeholder icon

- **Image Component:**
  - Shows skeleton while loading
  - Smooth fade-in when loaded (300ms)
  - Fallback UI for failed loads
  - Lazy loading support (`loading="lazy"`)
  - Error handling with placeholder icon

### ✅ 5. Implement prefers-reduced-motion media query support
**Files Created:**
- `lib/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts` - Custom React hook for motion preferences

**Files Modified:**
- `app/globals.css` - Enhanced CSS media queries
- `components/PresentationContainer.tsx` - Integrated reduced motion support

**Implementation:**
- **useReducedMotion Hook:**
  - Detects system preference via media query
  - Updates dynamically when preference changes
  - Provides helper functions for duration and transition adjustments

- **CSS Support:**
  - Reduces all animations to 0.01ms when preferred
  - Disables animation iterations
  - Disables smooth scrolling
  - Applies to all elements including pseudo-elements

- **Component Integration:**
  - PresentationContainer respects motion preferences
  - All animations automatically adjust based on user preference
  - Maintains functionality while reducing motion

## Additional Enhancements

### Animation Utilities Library
**File:** `lib/animations.ts`

Created comprehensive animation variant library:
- Slide transitions
- Container/item stagger variants
- Hover effects
- Fade animations (in, from top, from bottom)
- Scale animations
- Pulse effects
- Slide-in variants (left, right)
- Transition presets (spring, smooth, fast, slow)

### Documentation
**File:** `ANIMATIONS.md`

Created comprehensive documentation covering:
- Animation system overview
- Component-specific animations
- Animation utilities
- Performance considerations
- Accessibility best practices
- Testing instructions
- Future enhancements

### Component Exports
**File:** `components/ui/index.ts`

Updated to export new components:
- `Image` component
- `ImageSkeleton` component

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
1. **GPU Acceleration:** All animations use `transform` and `opacity`
2. **Lazy Loading:** Images use native lazy loading
3. **Tree Shaking:** Framer Motion is optimally bundled
4. **Minimal Re-renders:** Animations don't trigger unnecessary renders

### Accessibility Features
1. **Reduced Motion Support:** Full system preference detection
2. **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements accessible
3. **Focus Management:** Visible focus indicators maintained
4. **Screen Reader Friendly:** Animations don't interfere with assistive tech

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- Framer Motion supports all evergreen browsers
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Media query support for motion preferences

## Build Status
✅ **Build Successful**
- No TypeScript errors
- No critical ESLint errors
- Bundle size optimized (188 kB First Load JS)
- Static export ready for deployment

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Slide Transitions:**
   - Navigate between slides using arrow keys
   - Verify smooth slide-in from right/left
   - Test touch gestures on mobile

2. **Hover Effects:**
   - Hover over cards and buttons
   - Verify scale and shadow animations
   - Test on different screen sizes

3. **Loading States:**
   - Throttle network in DevTools
   - Verify skeleton screens appear
   - Check smooth fade-in when loaded

4. **Reduced Motion:**
   - Enable reduced motion in system preferences
   - Verify animations are minimal
   - Ensure functionality remains intact

### Automated Testing (Future)
- Unit tests for animation variants
- Integration tests for reduced motion
- Visual regression tests for animations
- Performance benchmarks

## Requirements Verification

✅ **Requirement 16.1:** Slide transitions with Framer Motion (300-500ms)
✅ **Requirement 16.2:** Staggered fade-in with 100ms delay
✅ **Requirement 16.3:** Hover animations (scale 1.05 with shadow)
✅ **Requirement 16.4:** Loading skeleton screens for images
✅ **Requirement 16.5:** Prefers-reduced-motion support

## Files Created/Modified

### Created (7 files)
1. `components/ui/ImageSkeleton.tsx`
2. `components/ui/Image.tsx`
3. `lib/animations.ts`
4. `lib/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts`
5. `ANIMATIONS.md`
6. `TASK_17_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified (4 files)
1. `components/ui/Card.tsx` - Added Framer Motion hover effects
2. `components/ui/Button.tsx` - Enhanced with variant-specific animations
3. `components/ui/index.ts` - Added new component exports
4. `app/globals.css` - Enhanced reduced motion support
5. `components/PresentationContainer.tsx` - Integrated reduced motion hook

## Next Steps

The animation system is now fully implemented and ready for use. The next tasks in the implementation plan are:

- **Task 18:** Implement responsive design and mobile optimization
- **Task 19:** Add Thai language content throughout
- **Task 20:** Implement external links and interactive features

## Notes

- All existing slide components (Slide01-Slide12) already had staggered animations implemented
- The PresentationContainer already had slide transitions in place
- This task enhanced and standardized the animation system
- Created reusable utilities for consistent animations across the app
- Full accessibility support ensures inclusive user experience
