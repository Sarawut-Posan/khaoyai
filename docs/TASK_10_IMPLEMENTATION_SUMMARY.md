## Integration Testing

### Admin → Presentation Flow
1. ✅ Edit trip info in admin → appears in Slide 01
2. ✅ Edit timeline in admin → appears in timeline slides
3. ✅ Edit activities in admin → appears in Slide 04
4. ✅ Edit restaurants in admin → appears in restaurant slides
5. ✅ Upload images in admin → images load in presentation

### Data Flow Verification
```
Admin UI → API Route → Data Service → content.json
                                          ↓
Presentation ← useContentData Hook ← content.json
```

All data flows correctly through the system.
