# Animation Implementation Verification Checklist

## Task 17: Implement animations and transitions ✅

### Sub-task Verification

#### ✅ 1. Configure Framer Motion slide transition variants (slide-in from right)
- [x] Slide transitions implemented in `PresentationContainer.tsx`
- [x] Variants defined in `lib/animations.ts`
- [x] Spring physics configured (stiffness: 300, damping: 30)
- [x] Direction-aware animations (right/left based on navigation)
- [x] Opacity fade during transitions (300ms)
- [x] AnimatePresence for exit animations

**Test:** Navigate between slides using arrow keys or swipe gestures

#### ✅ 2. Add staggered fade-in for slide elements (100ms delay)
- [x] Container variants created with stagger configuration
- [x] Item variants with fade-in from below (20px offset)
- [x] 100ms delay between elements (staggerChildren: 0.1)
- [x] Applied to all slide components
- [x] Configurable stagger presets (fast, normal, slow)

**Test:** Watch slide content appear sequentially when navigating

#### ✅ 3. Implement hover animations (scale 1.05 with shadow)
- [x] Card component enhanced with whileHover
- [x] Scale: 1.05 on hover
- [x] Shadow increases from md to lg
- [x] Button component with variant-specific hovers
- [x] Tap animations (scale 0.95-0.98)
- [x] 300ms transition duration

**Test:** Hover over cards and buttons to see scale and shadow effects

#### ✅ 4. Add loading skeleton screens for images
- [x] ImageSkeleton component created
- [x] Pulsing animation (opacity: 0.5 → 0.8 → 0.5)
- [x] 1.5s infinite loop
- [x] Image component with loading states
- [x] Smooth fade-in when loaded (300ms)
- [x] Fallback UI for failed loads
- [x] Lazy loading support

**Test:** Throttle network in DevTools to see skeleton screens

#### ✅ 5. Implement prefers-reduced-motion media query support
- [x] useReducedMotion hook created
- [x] System preference detection
- [x] Dynamic updates when preference changes
- [x] CSS media query in globals.css
- [x] All animations reduced to 0.01ms when preferred
- [x] PresentationContainer integrated with hook
- [x] Helper functions for duration/transition adjustments

**Test:** Enable reduced motion in system preferences and verify minimal animations
